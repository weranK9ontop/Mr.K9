# Mr.OVERDOSE
I was Mr.K9 but I changed my user to mr.overdose
because I OD and was close to death but I'm okay now and now I can see my family
and my girlfriend, She means the world to me she gives me happiness 
she makes me smile when I'm on the phone with her she mine everything 
I can trust her now she is better than Star and all my exes who used me
for my money and fam and my heart and my soul too they broke me in half
but when she came along she fixed my half-too-full I love you, Ally 
This is a letter for my love Ally she gives me the world now I can see
now, The truth is I'm in love with Ally she mines everything she the key
of my heart she have the key of my heart now she mines world she mines sun in the
in the night her smile is the sun of my heart and she mine demon in the night 
I LOVE YOU ALLY
